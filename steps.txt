1. install/launch virtual environment
    pip3 install pipenv
    pipenv shell -> which will start your virtenv

2. Install face_recognition
    pipenv install face_recognition

3. Install tolerance for face_recognition implementation
    pip3 install tolerance

4. run a match on known and unknown to see which of these are pictures of specific people
    $ face_recognition ./img/known ./img/unknown
        *notice that the gates look alike on the unkown folder is actually marked as "bill gates"
        *we can show the distance of each match with:
            $ face_recognition --show-distance true ./img/known ./img/unknown
            *gives us a number for the differences between pictures 
            * you can set a tolerance and implement it for stronger differences using:
                $ face_recognition --tolerance 0.50 ./img/known ./img/unknown

5. If you want just a list of names of the faces of the people in the image, you can do:
    $ face_recognition ./img/known ./img/unknown | cut -d ',' -f2
